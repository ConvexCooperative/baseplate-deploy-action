# baseplate-deploy-action

Github action for deploying to baseplate

## Usage

Within your Github Workflow yaml file, add the following. You'll need to replace `GIT_TAG` with the latest published version. See [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) to find the latest version.

```yml
# Replace 1.1.0 with the latest version found in CHANGELOG.md
uses: JustUtahCoders/baseplate-deploy-action@1.1.0
with:
  baseplate-token: ${{ secrets.BASEPLATE_TOKEN }}
  microfrontend-name: navbar
  environment-name: prod
  upload-dir: dist
  entry-file: main.js
```
